This program takes a user input message as a string and reduces the number of characters in two different ways while maintaining the important information of the message. The first way the message is compressed is by removing every vowel that is not at the start of a word or the first character of the message and removing every repeated non-vowel character. The program then outputs the shortened message, the number of vowels removed, the number of repeated non-vowel characters removed and how much shorter the shortened message is than the original. The second way the message is compressed is by taking each unique character in the order they appear and putting that letter and the number of times it appears in the message into a shorted message. The program will then output the shortened message, the number of times each unique character appears and how much shorter the shortend message is than the original.
